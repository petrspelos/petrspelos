== I'm Using GitHub Under Protest ==

My projects are currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop my FOSS projects. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

My projects will slowly migrated to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/spelos).
